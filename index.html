            <h3>Note:</h3>
            <p> Grilled cheese is great on a grill, but for a quicker method, try using a clamshell panini press. The result will be much quicker, allowing you to make many more for you and your friends.
                Remember, Shaun says <q>Grilled cheese sandwiches are a staple of the North American diet!</q>
